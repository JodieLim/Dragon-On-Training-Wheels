				<div class="container-fluid margot-bodytext class" id="barbarianFullText">
					<h4>Barbarian:</h4>
					<h4>These folks are some of the toughest in town. They can take blows and give ‘em too! </h4>
					<p>Armor: Light armor, Medium armor, Shields</p>
					<p>Weapons: Barbarians are proficient in all weapons.</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d12 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Strength, Constitution</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: None</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Animal Handling: Nice if you care about roleplaying.</li>
							<li>Athletics: As you are probably one of the strength based units, it might be good to pick this up.</li>
							<li>Intimidation: Nice if you care about roleplaying. However, if your charisma sucks, this isn’t recommended.</li>
							<li>Nature: Not highly recommended. Leave this to your cleric, druid, or ranger.</li>
							<li>Perception: This is one of the most useful skills in the game. Perception checks are extremely important in DND. It helps to know what is going on and hit things before they try to hit you!</li>
							<li>Survival: Great for tracking down enemies, finding a good campsite, and generally a very helpful skill.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Constitution: You will be ideally tanking hits for your party. You’ll need the beef to back it up.</li>
							<li>Strength: Rage is entirely dependent on your strength stat. The entire class is built around this attribute. Also, in order to make the most out of melee weapons, you’ll need to be using strength.</li>
							<li>Dexterity: This is still extremely valuable as you’ll need it to dodge spells and have high initiative. Also, it helps you use ranged weapons should you desire to.</li>
						</ul>
						Note: Wisdom is also recommended. It is generally good to be perceptive but also to resist possession. This will also make more roleplay sense for future Totem Barbarians.
					</p>
					<p>I would like to RAGE!! The barbarian class is entirely dependent on the rage mechanic. Barbarians can go into a rage as a bonus action and receive different benefits, including getting advantage (roll twice and take the higher roll) on Strength checks and saving throws, a bonus to melee weapon attacks, and resistance to different physical damage. As you grow and choose a specialization, your rage will get different benefits and powers.</p>
					<p><h4>Barbarians specialize at level 3. They pick their PRIMAL PATH:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Path of the Ancestral Guardian: You have ancestral spirits that guide and protect you and your friends.</li>
							<li>Path of the Berserker: You’re a classic barbarian. Your rages get more powerful.</li>
							<li>Path of the Storm Herald: You can receive the power of the desert, sea, or tundra. The corresponding effect determines what aura and powers you receive.</li>
							<li>Path of the Totem Warrior: You learn the way of animals, and you gain animalistic powers that increase your battle prowess.</li>
							<li>Path of the Zealot: You become a divine warrior, and divine energy powers your attacks.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container-fluid margot-bodytext class collapse" id="bardFullText">
					<h4>Bard:</h4>
					<h4>Bards are spellcasters who’s spells come from their artistic endeavors. Their songs empower their compatriots, but can also be used to cast some nasty spells! Don’t underestimate these silver tongues!</h4>
					<p>Armor: Light armor</p>
					<p>Weapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, and shortswords.</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d8 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Dexterity, Charisma</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: Three musical instruments of your choice!</p>
					<p><h4>Skills: Any THREE you desire from the whole list! Pick whatever your heart desires, especially things that make sense for the character you’re making. In case you don’t know where to start, here are some nice quality of life recommendations:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Persuasion: Highly recommended. You’ll already have the charisma to back it up. It’s nice being able to get your way just by asking nicely.</li>
							<li>Deception: Same as persuasion, your charisma stat will make this very useful to lie to get what you want. Pretend to be someone else, or lie about what you were doing!</li>
							<li>Perception: This is one of the most useful skills in the game. Perception checks are extremely important in DND. It helps to know what is going on and hit things before they try to hit you!</li>
							<li>Stealth: One of the most useful skills in the game. It’s nice to get where you need to go without provoking any attention from enemies!</li>
							</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Charisma: This is your spellcasting attribute, so consider it the most important one of all. All your spells will benefit from your charisma modifier. Also, it helps to be able to talk your way out of things!</li>
							<li>Dexterity: Many weapons bards can utilize depend on dexterity, whether it’s finesse weapons like rapiers, or any of the ranged weapons at their disposal. </li>
							<li>Constitution: It’s always nice to have health points. Keeps you alive longer! If you prefer your stats informing your roleplay, consider prioritizing Intelligence or Wisdom instead. Those can help you build a personality for your character!</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Bards are one of the most customizable classes. You can take a bard in any direction, whether it be more in a weapons combat direction, or a spellcasting direction.</p>
					<p>What makes bards special is the INSPIRATION mechanic. Bards can inspire others with their music, giving them bonuses to their rolls. This can really make a difference in hard times!</p>
					<p><h4>Bards specialize at level 3. You pick a BARDIC COLLEGE:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>College of Glamour: Your magic becomes powered by the fae and their illusions. You specialize in charms and glamor.</li>
							<li>College of Lore: You study more in what it means to be a spellcaster. You can take spells from other classes, even the most powerful (Wish).</li>
							<li>College of Swords: You become a master of the blade. You can use your magical talents to deal extra damage using a blade. You also gain proficiency in medium armor and scimitars.</li>
							<li>College of Valor: You hone your martial prowess. Opportunities to attack become more plentiful, and you can inspire your allies to become better in battle. You also gain proficiency in medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.</li>
							<li>College of Whispers: You lean into the ways of darkness and secrets.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container-fluid margot-bodytext class collapse" id="clericFullText">
					<h4>Cleric:</h4>
					<h4>Clerics are holy people who have devoted themselves to a divine force. Their powers come from one of the many different divine forces across the various pantheons. They are able to use these powers to help their fellows but also to punish their foes.</h4>
					<p>Armor: Light armor, medium armor, and shields</p>
					<p>Weapons: Clerics are proficient in all simple weapons.</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d8 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: None</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>History: Nice if you like roleplay. This is especially so if you care about details of the story.</li>
							<li>Insight: It’s nice to be able to call out someone’s BS.</li>
							<li>Medicine: Not very useful for multiple reasons. You’re the healer, and you can bring someone back from having to do their death saving throws just by healing. Your wisdom modifier can also usually make up for this. Medicine is especially useless if you have the Spare The Dying cantrip, which makes people automatically pass their death saving throws.</li>
							<li>Persuasion: Nice if you like roleplay. However, consider your own charisma stat and if you have more charismatic members of the party like a Paladin or Bard before taking this on.</li>
							<li>Religion: Nice if you like roleplay. You are also a person of faith! Some DMs might also ask for this check frequently if you try to do things related to your deity.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Wisdom: This is your spellcasting attribute, so consider it the most important one of all. All your spells will benefit from your wisdom modifier. Also, it’s nice being able to see things coming!</li>
							<li>Constitution: It’s generally nice if the healer doesn’t die from one kick to the shin.</li>
							<li>Dexterity: This is nice because it helps you use ranged weapons and stay away from the heat of the battle. It can also boost your AC too. It especially helps you survive spell damage that other long range magic users might be throwing your way.</li>
						</ul>
						Note: Strength can be a recommended stat if you are going to build a frontlines cleric. Frontlines clerics are recommended to be something proficient in heavy armor, like Forge, Life, Protection, Tempest, or War clerics.
					</p>
					<p>While clerics can vary based on the domain they choose, they are still spellcasters to the core. Generally, they will want to attack using spells, such as the Sacred Flame cantrip. They usually want to stay to the sidelines, but with the right build focusing on constitution and another physical stat, can be front liners.</p>
					<p><h4>Clerics specialize at level 1. You pick a DOMAIN related to your deity:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Forge Domain: Your deity is one one of the great artisans and crafters. You are imbued with the power of the forge. You gain proficiency with heavy armor.</li>
							<li>Grave Domain: Your deity is one of the watchers over life and death. You respect that all things must come to an end. You are imbued with their powers and can to an extent manipulate the boundary of life and death.<li>
							<li>Knowledge Domain: Your deity is one of the keepers of wisdom and learning. You are able to tap into arcane knowledge like the thoughts of others or visions of the past as you grow more powerful. You also gain proficiency in two more languages, and two of the following skills (Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion).</li>
							<li>Life Domain: Your deity is one who promotes vitality and shows mercy to those sick and wounded. Your healing powers are heightened and even more powerful than your fellow clerics. You also gain proficiency in heavy armor.</li>
							<li>Light Domain: Your deity is one of the light. There are virtues that correspond with light, such as truth, beauty, and renewal. Your radiant powers are heightened, making you especially dangerous to fiends and the undead.</li>
							<li>Nature Domain: Your deity is one of the many forces of nature. While druids worship nature as a whole, you align yourself with a specific deity and their ways. You are able to commune with flora and fauna alike.</li>
							<li>Protection Domain: Your deity calls upon you to protect the weak from the strong. You are given powerful defensive abilities. You also get a proficiency in heavy armor.</li>
							<li>Tempest Domain: Your deity is one of the great and powerful forces who govern over the storm, sea, or sky. You are given powerful storm based combat abilities. You also gain proficiency in martial weapons and heavy armor.</li>
							<li>Trickery Domain: Your deity is one of the great tricksters, whether they be a scoundrel or a thief or a rebel. You are skilled in the ways of stealth and duplicity.</li>
							<li>War Domain: Your deity is one of combat, whether it be a deity of justice or a deity of destruction. You are given martial prowess in battle, and the ability to inspire martial prowess in others as well. You are given proficiency in martial weapons and heavy armor.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container-fluid margot-bodytext class collapse" id="druidFullText">
					<h4>Druid:</h4>
					<h4>Druids are those who gain their powers from the forces of nature. They have the ability to elemental spells but also to transform into animals.</h4>
					<p>Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields</p>
					<p>Weapons: Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d8 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: Herbalism Kit</p>
					<p>Note: You are also proficient in the Druidic language. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden languages. People can find the message on a successful DC 15 Perception check, but can’t decipher it without magic.</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Arcana: If you have good intelligence, you can consider this. However, this should really be left up to whoever is the Int person on your team. If you’re a nerd, feel free.</li>
							<li>Animal Handling: Nice if you like roleplay, but can actually be useful to get out of some situations. If there’s any class to be proficient in animal handling, it’s the druid. You also have the Wis to back it up.</li>
							<li>Insight: It’s nice to be able to call out people’s BS.</li>
							<li>Medicine: You might want to pick this up if you’re the party’s primary healer. The main use Medicine sees is trying to stabilize bodies so players don’t have to roll death saving throws. If you have a cleric in your party, you really don’t need this because you should have high wis anyways.</li>
							<li>Nature: Nice if you like roleplay and if it’s campaign relevant. If there’s any class to be proficient in nature, it’s the druid. However, your wisdom might be enough to boost you to the point where you don’t really need your proficiency bonus.</li>
							<li>Perception: This is one of the most useful skills in the game. Perception checks are extremely important in DND. It helps to know what is going on and hit things before they try to hit you!</li>
							<li>Religion: Not vital, and you only can pick two from this list. If you want it for roleplaying, maybe consider </li>
							<li>Survival: Great for tracking down enemies, finding a good campsite, and generally a very helpful skill. This will be bolstered by your high Wisdom.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Wisdom: This is your spellcasting attribute, so consider it the most important one of all. All your spells will benefit from your wisdom modifier. Make sure this stat is the highest.</li>
							<li>Dexterity: This is nice because it helps you use ranged weapons and stay away from the heat of the battle. It can also boost your AC too. It especially helps you survive spell damage that other long range magic users might be throwing your way.</li>
							<li>Constitution: Always a nice generic stat to choose, as it gives you more hit points. However, if you care about roleplaying, feel free to focus on any of the other mental attributes.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Druids are fun because there’s a few different ways to go about building your funky nature friend. You can pursue spells, buffs, frontlines, whatever you’d like.</p>
					<p>Druids are notable for their Wild Shape ability. This means they can transform into animals and fight using the animal’s physical stats. They can’t cast spells in this form until much later in the game, but their martial prowess is still not one to be underestimated.</p>
					<p><h4>Druids specialize at level 2. You pick your DRUIDIC CIRCLE:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Circle of Dreams: These druids have an emphasis on healing and mobility, as they get teleportation in later levels.</li>
							<li>Circle of the Land: These druids have an emphasis on spellcasting. If you want to cast spells, this is the class to be.</li>
							<li>Circle of the Moon: These druids have good survivability in exchange for having less boons to their spellcasting.</li>
							<li>Circle of the Shepherd: These druids have summoning capabilities, which allows them to buff their companions and also be in the frontlines.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container-fluid margot-bodytext class collapse" id="fighterFullText">
					<h4>Fighter:</h4>
					<h4>Fighters are exactly what it says on the tin. I mean, everyone else fights too. But they fight MORE.</h4>
					<p>Armor: All armor and shields</p>
					<p>Weapons: Simple weapons and martial weapons</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d10 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Strength, Constitution</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: None</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Acrobatics: Being proficient in this or Athletics is a safe bet. You don’t really need both.</li>
							<li>Animal Handling: Nice if you like roleplay. Still, as you’re picking two from this list, you might want to leave it to your druid.</li>
							<li>Athletics: Being proficient in this or Acrobatics is a safe bet. You don’t really need both.</li>
							<li>History: Nice if you like roleplay and have some Int. Makes more sense if you’re a spellcaster fighter, otherwise leave this to your wizard.</li>
							<li>Insight: It’s nice to be able to call out other people’s BS.</li>
							<li>Intimidation: Not really a recommended stat unless you have some charisma. Otherwise, leave the talking to the bards and paladins.</li>
							<li>Perception: This is one of the most useful skills in the game. Perception checks are extremely important in DND. It helps to know what is going on and hit things before they try to hit you!</li>
							<li>Survival: Great for tracking down enemies, finding a good campsite, and generally a very helpful skill.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Dexterity: You might wonder why dexterity is at the top of the list, but dexterity is hands down the most important statistic in 5th edition. It helps you go first during combat, dodge attacks, and you can even attack using this for your ranged and finesse weapons. You can’t go wrong with dexterity.</li>
							<li>Strength: Still a very important aspect for fighters. This is less important if you decide to fully build a dexterity based fighter and use finesse weapons and ranged weapons. However, if nobody else in your party emphasizes their strength stat, you should still prioritize this for balance. If you want to be strictly melee, this is also the stat to go for.</li>
							<li>Constitution: You’re a fighter, so you’ll need to be in the frontlines. You’ll need the beef to back it up.</li>
						</ul>
						Note: Wisdom is also recommended. It is generally good to be perceptive but also to resist possession. This will also make more roleplay sense for future Totem Barbarians.
					</p>
					<p>Fighting is what you do. Picking this class means sacrificing some more of the flavor and embracing more of the punch. There are some more flavorful subclasses, but you’re really here because you want to be good at punch.</p>
						<p><h4>Fighters specialize at level 3. You pick a MARTIAL ARCHETYPE. (Note: Feel free to replace “punch” with “stab” or “shoot”):</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Champion: You’re great at punching. Perfect for new players.</li>
							<li>Battle Master: You gain maneuvers that help you in battle. You are still good at punching.</li>
							<li>Eldritch Knight: You get to mix some of that punching with some spells. Your spells primarily focus around defense, whether it be for yourself or others, as you punch real good.</li>
							<li>Arcane Archer: You are so good at shooting arrows. Your arrows can even have special properties or powers, and you can cast some minor spells.</li>
							<li>Cavalier: It’s more than just having a mount. You are also a powerful defender as you punch from atop your horse.</li>
							<li>Samurai: An interesting subclass that adds some more roleplay spice into the class. Also, you are still very, very good at punching.</li>
						</ul>

					<h4>Monk:</h4>
					<h4>Monks are those who have taken up some kind of discipline or order. They are skilled in martial arts, and these dexterity based fighters are nothing to mess with.</h4>
					<p>Armor: Light armor</p>
					<p>Weapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, and shortswords.</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d8 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Dexterity, Charisma</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: Three musical instruments of your choice!</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Acrobatics: You are a very dexterous person. If you want to get away with some parkour outside of battle, this is a good skill to take.</li>
							<li>Athletics: If you’re going to take this, just take acrobatics.</li>
							<li>History: Nice if you like roleplay.</li>
							<li>Insight: It’s nice to see through people’s BS. Also, you should have some hefty wis to boost this.</li>
							<li>Religion: Nice if you like roleplay. Relevance might depend on the campaign you play.</li>
							<li>Stealth: One of the most useful skills in the game. It’s nice to get where you need to go without provoking any attention from enemies! Highly recommend taking this on, as you should have the dexterity to boost it.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Dexterity: This is one of the most important stats in the game, and doubly important for you. Not only does it help you go earlier in battle and dodge magic attacks, but your armor class will be decided by your Dexterity and Wisdom. It will also determine the strength of your attacks, as all monks can use martial arts to attack from dexterity instead of strength.</li>
							<li>Wisdom: This helps determine your armor class, which is very important as you are a front liner. Also, if you cast spells, you’ll be casting from your wisdom.</li>
							<li>Constitution: As a frontliner, this stat is especially important to you. Don’t worry about strength as your dexterity is your strength and eliminates all need for that.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>This class is entirely dex based. Ki points are the most significant part of this class, as they are what allow monks to do some of their more intense abilities. Monks fight in an extremely dextrous way, having the ability to catch projectiles, fall from great distances without being hurt, and run across water.</p>
						<p><h4>Monks specialize at level 3. They pick a MONASTIC TRADITION:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Way of the Open Hand: You are a very talented martial artist. Did you like Ty Lee on Avatar? It’s like that.</li>
							<li>Way of Shadow: Do you want to be a ninja? This is it.</li>
							<li>Way of Four Elements: Pick this if you want to be the avatar. That’s really what this is. You get some elemental spells.</li>
							<li>Way of Drunken Master: Sure do love that… cola. There’s some fun redirection that’s to be expected by the title.</li>
							<li>Way of the Kensei: If you like the idea of armed martial arts, this is the one for you.</li>
							<li>Way of the Sun Soul: You get some cool hadouken abilities! Blast people with the power of sun.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container-fluid margot-bodytext class collapse" id="paladinFullText">
					<h4>Paladin:</h4>
					<h4>Paladins are to clerics as rangers are to druids. These warriors have taken up an oath to serve a deity, and receive impressive divine combat prowess. They also have some powers of healing as well.</h4>
					<p>Armor: All armor and shields.</p>
					<p>Weapons: Simple weapons and martial weapons</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d10 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: None</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Athletics: As you are probably one of the strength based units, it might be good to pick this up.</li>
							<li>Insight: It’s nice to see through people’s BS.</li>
							<li>Intimidation: Nice if you like roleplay. This is especially so if you like throwing your weight around. If you’d rather talk your way out of things civilly, take persuasion.</li>
							<li>Medicine: Really do not recommend this one. You have lay on hands, and can stabilize dying bodies doing their death saving throws by just giving them one hit point. Let your cleric or druid with higher wis take care of this.</li>
							<li>Persuasion: You’ll already have the charisma to back it up. It’s nice being able to get your way just by asking nicely. A little bit better than intimidation because you don’t always have to be mean to get what you want.</li>
							<li>Religion: Nice if you like roleplay. Relevance depends on the campaign.</li>
							</ul>
					</p>

						Note: Wisdom is also recommended. It is generally good to be perceptive but also to resist possession.
					</p>
					<p>Paladins are sort of a mixed bag. They’re primarily melee fighters, and a lot of their skills in this build are designed around that. They have some abilities to heal and buff, but really they’re here to do damage. Keep in mind you are as bulky as you make yourself out to be, whether it be in constitution or in dexterity.</p>
						<p><h4>Paladins specialize at level 3. They pick a SACRED OATH:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Oath of Devotion: This is the most vanilla a paladin will get. If you’re fighting vampires or the undead, this is a great choice.</li>
							<li>Oath of the Ancients: If you want to build a paladin with a naturey twist, this is the class for you!</li>
							<li>Oath of Vengeance: If you want something edgier, you can build a paladin with some darker themes. This paladin is more offensive and good on the hunt.</li>
							<li>Oath of Conquest: This is if you want to be an imperial warrior. Your powers revolve the idea of fear and domination.</li>
							<li>Oath of Redemption: This is a paladin of peace, maybe one who is redeeming themselves for a past crime, or simply someone who wants to see peace for all.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

				<div class="container-fluid margot-bodytext class collapse" id="rangerFullText">
					<h4>Ranger:</h4>
					<h4>Rangers, like druids, are very close to nature. They range from hunters to beastmasters.</h4>
					<p>Armor: Light armor, Medium armor, Shields</p>
					<p>Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d10 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Strength, Dexterity</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: None</p>
					<p><h4>THREE skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Animal Handling: Makes a lot of sense for a ranger to be good with animals. It’s a little situationally useful, however, if your character likes animals you should probably take this on.</li>
							<li>Athletics: Shouldn’t be your priority, especially for a ranger. Let someone more strength focused take this one.</li>
							<li>Insight: It’s nice to be able to see through people’s BS. You also have some wis to bolster this.</li>
							<li>Investigation: Don’t take this, take perception. Your wis should be far superior to your int.</li>
							<li>Nature: More situationally useful than anything else.</li>
							<li>Perception: This is one of the most useful skills in the game. Perception checks are extremely important in DND. It helps to know what is going on and hit things before they try to hit you!</li>
							<li>Stealth: One of the most useful skills in the game. It’s nice to get where you need to go without provoking any attention from enemies! Highly recommend taking this on, as you should have the dexterity to boost it.</li>
							<li>Survival: If anyone should be good at this, it’s you. Great for tracking down enemies, finding a good campsite, and generally a very helpful skill.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Dexterity: This informs a lot of your abilities as a ranger, whether it’s dealing damage or stealthing ahead so you can scout. Definitely make sure this is your highest stat.</li>
							<li>Wisdom: This also informs a lot of your abilities, such as your survival rolls, your spells and also your perception. Definitely don’t neglect this stat.</li>
							<li>Constitution:  It’d be nice if getting hit once doesn’t kill you. However, you are a long distance fighter, and if you would like to pick up a different mental stat for some roleplay fun, feel free!</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Rangers as to Druids as Paladins are to Clerics. They are similar to Druids and possess the capability to cast spells, however their skillset is invested elsewhere. This class is very powerful at the beginning, but then plateaus at higher levels. If you are invested in the “meta” and want to be the most powerful, ranger is not a recommended class. However, if you enjoy the roleplay and it fits your character, we very much encourage you to take this class on!</p>
						<p><h4>Rangers specialize at level 3. They pick a RANGER ARCHETYPE:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Beast Master: This is for if you want a pet, plain and simple. Your companion is able to fight at your side!</li>
							<li>Gloom Stalker: This class is perfect if your ranger is someone hanging out in the Underdark.</li>
							<li>Horizon Walker: Pick this if you want a ranger with great mobility and, well, range!</li>
							<li>Hunter: This is what it says on the tin. An offensively oriented Ranger that specializes in fighting different kinds of encounters.</li>
							<li>Monster Slayer: Do you like Monster Hunter? This is like Monster Hunter.</li>
						</ul>

					<h4>Rogue:</h4>
					<h4>These folks are some of the toughest in town. They can take blows and give ‘em too! </h4>
					<p>Armor: Light armor, Medium armor, Shields</p>

					<p>Hit Dice: 1d12 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Strength, Constitution</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: None</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>

							<li>Athletics: As you are probably one of the strength based units, it might be good to pick this up.</li>
							<li>Intimidation: Nice if you care about roleplaying. However, if your charisma sucks, this isn’t recommended.</li>
							<li>Nature: Not highly recommended. Leave this to your cleric, druid, or ranger.</li>
							<li>Perception: This is one of the most useful skills in the game. Perception checks are extremely important in DND. It helps to know what is going on and hit things before they try to hit you!</li>
							<li>Survival: Great for tracking down enemies, finding a good campsite, and generally a very helpful skill.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Constitution: You will be ideally tanking hits for your party. You’ll need the beef to back it up.</li>
							<li>Strength: Rage is entirely dependent on your strength stat. The entire class is built around this attribute. Also, in order to make the most out of melee weapons, you’ll need to be using strength.</li>
							<li>Dexterity: This is still extremely valuable as you’ll need it to dodge spells and have high initiative. Also, it helps you use ranged weapons should you desire to.</li>
						</ul>
						Note: Wisdom is also recommended. It is generally good to be perceptive but also to resist possession. This will also make more roleplay sense for future Totem Barbarians.
					</p>
					<p>I would like to RAGE!! The barbarian class is entirely dependent on the rage mechanic. Barbarians can go into a rage as a bonus action and receive different benefits, including getting advantage (roll twice and take the higher roll) on Strength checks and saving throws, a bonus to melee weapon attacks, and resistance to different physical damage. As you grow and choose a specialization, your rage will get different benefits and powers.</p>
					<p><h4>Barbarians specialize at level 3. They pick their PRIMAL PATH:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Path of the Ancestral Guardian: You have ancestral spirits that guide and protect you and your friends.</li>
							<li>Path of the Berserker: You’re a classic barbarian. Your rages get more powerful.</li>
							<li>Path of the Storm Herald: You can receive the power of the desert, sea, or tundra. The corresponding effect determines what aura and powers you receive.</li>
							<li>Path of the Totem Warrior: You learn the way of animals, and you gain animalistic powers that increase your battle prowess.</li>
							<li>Path of the Zealot: You become a divine warrior, and divine energy powers your attacks.</li>
