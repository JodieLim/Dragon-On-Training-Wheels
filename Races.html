						<p>One of the most important parts of creating your character is choosing their race. Race determines a lot of things, from statistics to special traits. Choose a race and Margot will bring one of her friends over to explain it to you! </p>
						<p>Be mindful that the history of these races may differ for some campaigns, so be sure to ask your DM what the culture of these races are in your campaign!</p>
						<p>You might choose a race before or after you roll your dice to make a character. Choosing a race might be beneficial to maximizing some of your stats (i.e. you have a high roll and a bonus to dexterity, so you boost your rogue to 20 dexterity with a +5 modifier). You also might use it to mitigate some of your weaknesses. For example, you might decide intelligence is a “dump stat” for your character. You decide to use 9, your lowest number, which has a modifier of -1. However, you make your character a gnome, which means you add +2 to your Intelligence, giving your character 11 intelligence, which is actually a +0! This means you don’t have any negative modifiers.</p>
						<p>Keep in mind that any race can be any class. There is a very feasible build with every combination! You don’t have to make something stereotypical like a dwarf barbarian, feel free to make a dwarf druid or a dwarf sorcerer! Choosing a nontraditional combination might make for fun roleplay, as it’s only important that your stats back up your class more than anything else.</p>

						<h4>Dwarf:</h4>
						<h4>Meet Xena!</h4>
						<p>Dwarves mature at the same rate as human, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years. Xena is age 30, and still considered pretty young!</p>
						<p>They’re about 4 to 5 feet tall and are considered “Medium” size. Xena is 4’6”, which is an average height for dwarves!</p>
						<p>Their walking speed is 25 feet, but their speed isn’t reduced by wearing Heavy Armor.</p>
						<p>Darkvision: Xena has darkvision, which means she can see in the dark! She can’t make out color in the darkness, only shades of grades.</p>
						<p>Dwarven Resilience: Xena has resilience to poison damage, which means that whatever damage she would take is halved. She also has advantage on saving throws against poison.</p>
						<p>Dwarven Combat Training: Being a dwarf, Xena was raised surrounded by classic dwarven weapons. She has proficiency with battleaxes, handaxes, throwing hammers, and warhammers.</p>
						<p>Tool Proficiency: Dwarves get to pick whether they are proficient in smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools. Xena is proficient with smith’s tools, and likes making jewelry for fun.</p>
						<p>Stonecunning: Dwarves have a special eye for stonework. Xena is considered proficient for History checks for stonework. Her proficiency bonus will be doubled!</p>
						<p>Being a dwarf, Xena can speak Common and Dwarvish.</p>

						<h4>There are two dwarf subraces, Hill and Mountain:</h4>
						<p>Hill dwarves:</p>
						<ul><li>Hill dwarves receive a +1 to wisdom</li>
							<li>Dwarven Toughness: On first level, and every time you gain a level, add +1 to your hit point total. For example, Xena is a rogue. At level 1 her hit dice is 1d8 and her constitution is 16 (+3). Her hit points at level 1 is equal to 8 + 3 + 1, or 12. Next level she’ll add a 1d8 + 3 + 1 to her current total. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>Mountain dwarves</p>
						<ul><li>Mountain dwarves receive a +1 to strength</li>
							<li>Dwarven Armor Training: You have proficiency in light and medium armor. </li>
						</ul>
