		<h1>Weapons</h1>
<p>There is a lot of combat in Dungeons & Dragons, and in order to fight, you’re going to need weapons. Weapons have two basic classifications: whether they are melee or ranged weapons, and whether they are simple or martial weapons. For example, a weapon could be a simple melee weapon or a martial ranged weapon.</p>

<h2>Melee Weapons</h2>
<p>Melee weapons are used to attack a target that is within five feet of you. Melee weapons are mostly used by sturdy characters who have enough HP to dash into battle. These weapons include things like swords and daggers.</p>

<h2>Ranged Weapons</h2>
<p>Ranged weapons are used to attack a target that is more than five feet from you. Ranged weapons are mostly used by weaker characters who want to stay out of direct combat. These weapons include things like bows and slings.</p>

<h2>Simple Weapons</h2>
<p>Most characters are proficient in simple weapons, which do not require specialized training. Simple weapons are mostly used by spellcasters (wizards, warlocks, druids, etc.) and include weapons such as clubs and maces.</p>

<h2>Martial Weapons</h2>
<p>Martial weapons require specialized training for a character to gain proficiency. Martial weapons are mostly used by warriors (fighters, rangers, rogues, etc.) and include weapons such as swords and longbows.</p>

<h2>Special Properties</h2>
Some weapons have special properties related to their use. Listed below are some of the most common properties you will encounter--see external resources for the full list!

			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Thrown
