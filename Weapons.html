			<h1>Weapons</h1>
</div>

			<p>There is a lot of combat in Dungeons & Dragons, and in order to fight, you’re going to need weapons. Weapons have two basic classifications: whether they are melee or ranged weapons, and whether they are simple or martial weapons. For example, a weapon could be a simple melee weapon or a martial ranged weapon. Once you understand weapons, Lily will explain how to attack with them!</p>

<div class="lily-text">
<h2>Melee Weapons</h2>
</div>
<p>Melee weapons are used to attack a target that is within five feet of you. The ability modifier applied to attacks made with ranged weapons is Strength. Melee weapons are mostly used by sturdy characters who have enough HP to dash into battle. These weapons include things like swords and daggers.</p>

<div class="lily-text">
<h2>Ranged Weapons</h2>
</div>
<p>Ranged weapons are used to attack a target that is more than five feet from you. The ability modifier applied to attacks made with ranged weapons is Dexterity. Ranged weapons are mostly used by weaker characters who want to stay out of direct combat. These weapons include things like bows and slings.</p>

<div class="lily-text">
<h2>Simple Weapons</h2>
</div>
<p>Most characters are proficient in simple weapons, which do not require specialized training. Simple weapons are mostly used by spellcasters (wizards, warlocks, druids, etc.) and include weapons such as clubs and maces.</p>

<div class="lily-text">
<h2>Martial Weapons</h2>
</div>
<p>Martial weapons require specialized training for a character to gain proficiency. Martial weapons are mostly used by warriors (fighters, rangers, rogues, etc.) and include weapons such as swords and longbows.</p>

<div class="lily-text">
<h2>Special Properties</h2>
</div>
Some weapons have special properties related to their use. Listed below are some of the most common properties you will encounter--see external resources for the full list!
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Ammunition</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>You need ammunition for this weapon in order to use it, like arrows for a shortbow</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Finesse</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>You can choose to use your dexterity modifier instead of your strength modifier when using this weapon</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Heavy</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Small creatures have disadvantage when using heavy weapons. They’re just too heavy!</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Thrown</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Exactly what it sounds like--you can throw this weapon to make a ranged attack. Roll the same as you would if you were making a melee attack</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Two-Handed</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>You need two hands to use this weapon</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Versatile</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>You can use this weapon with one hand or with two hands. It will do more damage if you use two hands!</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Improvised Weapons</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Anything. Really, anything! You could even use a dead goblin as an improvised weapon. These weapons always do 1d4 damage, unless the DM decides otherwise.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="lily-text">
	<h2>How to Attack</h2>
	</div>
	<p>To attack, you will need to roll a D20, then add the appropriate ability modifier and your proficiency bonus. If the result exceeds your opponent’s Armor Class (AC), then you will roll for damage, which varies depending on the specific weapon.</p>

	<div class="lily-text">
	<h2>Mad Libs Character Sheet</h2>
	</div>
	<p>My main weapon is ___. That means to attack, I will need to roll a D20, and then add my ___ modifier (which is ___) and my proficiency bonus (which is ___).</p>
