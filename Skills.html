			<h2>What are Skills?</h2>
	<p>Skills represent different aspects of each main attribute. If a character is proficient in a skill, that means they are better at that skill than average. Some of these skills might overlap, so it’s up to your DM to decide what check you need to make!</p>

	<h2>How do Skill Checks Work?</h2>
	<p>When your DM requests that you make a skill check, you will roll a D20 and add the modifier for the attribute that skill belongs to.
